# Pneumonia chest x-rays

## Project Abstract 

We explored machine learning algorithms used to classify patients based on the presence of pneumonia using their chest X-rays.

Pneumonia is a lung infection that ranges from mild to life-threatening consequences. In order to identify the infection, radiologists examine chest X-ray images to identify possible infection. By analyzing the “Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)” dataset on Kaggle, we aim to use machine learning algorithms to help identify the presence of Pneumonia in patients and to facilitate diagnosis at a larger scale.

The dataset consists of roughly 6,000 chest x-rays taken from pediatric patients in Guangzhou, China with each x-ray labeled “Pneumonia” or “Normal” as identified by two expert physicians. The types of models we considered include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Convolutional Neural Networks. In addition, we aimed to incorporate some feature engineering to augment these models.
